            <p>I am a computer science enthusiast who has been passionate about this field since the age of seven. I started my studies at ITT G. Giorgi, obtaining three CISCO
                certifications. At the end of five years of school, I passed the entrance test for the Poggiolevante Merit Institute in Bari where I studied Computer Science
                at the University of Bari Aldo Moro. I also took several courses at the institute, such as Android, C++, Java and PHP. I obtained a soft skills certification
                and learned how to work in a team. I also had the opportunity to work on a project for an IT company in Bisceglie, "Bisceglie Approdi." After two years of college,
                I started working as a junior developer at "Fincons Group" and obtained the AWS Developer Associate certificate. In September 2019 I moved to
                "YOOX-Net-A-Porter Group" as a developer, working on custom CMS built with React, Jquery and AWS technologies. In 2021 I started a new career as a
                Full Stack Developer at "Shopfully | Doveconviene.it". There I worked for an internal platform for the marketing team, which had the focus on
                custom campaigns integrated through google adv apis, using react, aws and php. After this adventure, I worked for 8 months as a senior software engineer
                for "Valassis Italia" in an international team and then started my own freelancer business, also launching a startup in the artificial intelligence sector
                and offering consulting services to companies.</p>
